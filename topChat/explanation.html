<i>topChat</i> is a self-contained, pseudo-CLI messaging interface.  Clients created by the service are able to<br>
send messages to topics, and receive messages from topics they're subscribed to.<br>
<br>
There are six commands:<br>
<br>
create<br>
topic<br>
list clients<br>
list topics<br>
subscribe<br>
send<br>
<br>
<b>create</b><br>
--<br>
The 'create' command is the starting point for <i>topChat</i>.  It generates client objects for you to interact<br>
with.  Note that running this command after already creating a set of clients will overwrite the exist<br>
clients with a new array of blank clients.<br>
<br>
<b>topic</b><br>
--<br>
The 'topic' command lets you create new topics.<br>
<br>
<b>list clients</b><br>
--<br>
The 'list clients' command tells you what all of the clients are currently subscribed to.<br>
<br>
<b>list topics</b><br>
--<br>
The 'list topics' command tells you all of the topics that currently exist.<br>
<br>
<b>subscribe</b><br>
--<br>
The 'subscribe' commmand lets you assign a client to a new topic.  If the topic doesn't yet exist, it<br>
will create the topic for you.<br>
<br>
<b>send</b><br>
--<br>
The 'send' command will broadcast a message that will be picked up by it's topic subscribers.<br>
<br>
<br>
